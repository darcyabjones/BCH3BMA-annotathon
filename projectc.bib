abstract = {SWISS-MODEL Repository (http://swissmodel.expasy.org/repository/) is a database of 3D protein structure models generated by the SWISS-MODEL homology-modelling pipeline. The aim of the SWISS-MODEL Repository is to provide access to an up-to-date collection of annotated 3D protein models generated by automated homology modelling for all sequences in Swiss-Prot and for relevant models organisms. Regular updates ensure that target coverage is complete, that models are built using the most recent sequence and template structure databases, and that improvements in the underlying modelling pipeline are fully utilised. As of September 2008, the database contains 3.4 million entries for 2.7 million different protein sequences from the UniProt database. SWISS-MODEL Repository allows the users to assess the quality of the models in the database, search for alternative template structures, and to build models interactively via SWISS-MODEL Workspace (http://swissmodel.expasy.org/workspace/). Annotation of models with functional information and cross-linking with other databases such as the Protein Model Portal (http://www.proteinmodelportal.org) of the PSI Structural Genomics Knowledge Base facilitates the navigation between protein sequence and structure resources.},

abstract = {A new approach to rapid sequence comparison, basic local alignment search tool (BLAST), directly approximates alignments that optimize a measure of local similarity, the maximal segment pair (MSP) score. Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straight-forward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

abstract = {Flux of dimethylsulfide (DMS) from ocean surface waters is the predominant natural source of sulfur to the atmosphere and influences climate by aerosol formation. Marine bacterioplankton regulate sulfur flux by converting the precursor dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) either to DMS or to sulfur compounds that are not climatically active. Through the discovery of a glycine cleavage T-family protein with DMSP methyltransferase activity, marine bacterioplankton in the Roseobacter and SAR11 taxa were identified as primary mediators of DMSP demethylation to methylmercaptopropionate. One-third of surface ocean bacteria harbor a DMSP demethylase homolog and thereby route a substantial fraction of global marine primary production away from DMS formation and into the marine microbial food web.},

abstract = {The branching order and coherence of the alphaproteobacterial orders have not been well established, and not all studies have agreed that mitochondria arose from within the Rickettsiales. A species tree for 72 alphaproteobacteria was produced from a concatenation of alignments for 104 well-behaved protein families. Coherence was upheld for four of the five orders with current standing that were represented here by more than one species. However, the family Hyphomonadaceae was split from the other Rhodobacterales, forming an expanded group with Caulobacterales that also included Parvularcula. The three earliest-branching alphaproteobacterial orders were the Rickettsiales, followed by the Rhodospirillales and then the Sphingomonadales. The principal uncertainty is whether the expanded Caulobacterales group is more closely associated with the Rhodobacterales or the Rhizobiales. The mitochondrial branch was placed within the Rickettsiales as a sister to the combined Anaplasmataceae and Rickettsiaceae, all subtended by the Pelagibacter branch. Pelagibacter genes will serve as useful additions to the bacterial outgroup in future evolutionary studies of mitochondrial genes, including those that have transferred to the eukaryotic nucleus.},

abstract = {Determination of creatinine is important in the clinical laboratory. Jaff\'{e} reaction has long been used to determine creatinine, but the method suffers from various interferences. To overcome this problem, the enzymatic methods were invented and have been used widely. Sarcosine oxidase has a critical role in the enzymatic method. Of sarcosine oxidases,Corynebacterium enzyme has been studied extensively in kinetic and structural aspects. The enzyme contains noncovalently bound and covalently bound FADs, and consists of 4 non-identical subunits (A, B, C, D). The covalently bound FAD is bound to the subunit B. The rate of oxidation of sarcosine was explained by the rates of the oxidation and reduction of the bound FADs. From the chemical modification of the enzyme with iodoacetamide, the amino acid sequence around the non-covalently bound FAD is suggested and the modification changed the enzyme so that the only noncovalently bound FAD functions in the oxidation of sarcosine.},

abstract = {Symbiobacterium thermophilum is an uncultivable bacterium isolated from compost that depends on microbial commensalism. The 16S ribosomal DNA-based phylogeny suggests that this bacterium belongs to an unknown taxon in the Gram-positive bacterial cluster. Here, we describe the 3.57 Mb genome sequence of S.thermophilum. The genome consists of 3338 protein-coding sequences, out of which 2082 have functional assignments. Despite the high G + C content (68.7\%), the genome is closest to that of Firmicutes, a phylum consisting of low G + C Gram-positive bacteria. This provides evidence for the presence of an undefined category in the Gram-positive bacterial group. The presence of both spo and related genes and microscopic observation indicate that S.thermophilum is the first high G + C organism that forms endospores. The S.thermophilum genome is also characterized by the widespread insertion of class C group II introns, which are oriented in the same direction as chromosomal replication. The genome has many membrane transporters, a number of which are involved in the uptake of peptides and amino acids. The genes involved in primary metabolism are largely identified, except those that code several biosynthetic enzymes and carbonic anhydrase. The organism also has a variety of respiratory systems including Nap nitrate reductase, which has been found only in Gram-negative bacteria. Overall, these features suggest that S.thermophilum is adaptable to and thus lives in various environments, such that its growth requirement could be a substance or a physiological condition that is generally available in the natural environment rather than a highly specific substance that is present only in a limited niche. The genomic information from S.thermophilum offers new insights into microbial diversity and evolutionary sciences, and provides a framework for characterizing the molecular basis underlying microbial commensalism.},

abstract = {We have isolated the gene encoding the glycine cleavage T-protein (GCV1) of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and shown through gene disruption and enzyme assays that inactivation of GCV1 destroys glycine cleavage function. A DNA fragment encoding the GCV1 gene was cloned by PCR amplification using degenerate oligodeoxyribonucleotides, and the cloned fragment was used as a probe to isolate the complete gene from a yeast genomic library. Growth with glycine stimulated expression of the GCV1 gene as determined by Northern analysis and increased the $\beta$-galactosidase activity of a GCV1-lacZ fusion 30-fold. The URA3 gene was inserted into the coding sequence of GCV1 and the resulting construct was used to disrupt the chromosomal GCV1 gene in a diploid strain of yeast. gcv1::URA3 haploid derivatives grew normally or only slightly more slowly than the isogenic wild-type haploids. All gcv1 strains studied were unable to grow on glycine as a sole nitrogen source and lacked glycine cleavage enzyme activity. Growth of shm1 shm2 mutants was stimulated by glycine, whereas glycine could not supplement the growth of the isogenic gcv1 strain.},

abstract = {"Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique," an abundant marine alphaproteobacterium, subsists in nature at low ambient nutrient concentrations and may often be exposed to nutrient limitation, but its genome reveals no evidence of global regulatory mechanisms for adaptation to stationary phase. High-resolution capillary liquid chromatography coupled online to an LTQ mass spectrometer was used to build an accurate mass and time (AMT) tag library that enabled quantitative examination of proteomic differences between exponential- and stationary-phase "Ca. Pelagibacter ubique" cells cultivated in a seawater medium. The AMT tag library represented 65\% of the predicted protein-encoding genes. "Ca. Pelagibacter ubique" appears to respond adaptively to stationary phase by increasing the abundance of a suite of proteins that contribute to homeostasis rather than undergoing a major remodeling of its proteome. Stationary-phase abundances increased significantly for OsmC and thioredoxin reductase, which may mitigate oxidative damage in "Ca. Pelagibacter," as well as for molecular chaperones, enzymes involved in methionine and cysteine biosynthesis, proteins involved in rho-dependent transcription termination, and the signal transduction enzyme CheY-FisH. We speculate that this limited response may enable "Ca. Pelagibacter ubique" to cope with ambient conditions that deprive it of nutrients for short periods and, furthermore, that the ability to resume growth overrides the need for a more comprehensive global stationary-phase response to create a capacity for long-term survival.},

abstract = {The glycine cleavage system catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of glycine in bacteria and in mitochondria of animals and plants. Its deficiency in human causes nonketotic hyperglycinemia, an inborn error of glycine metabolism. T-protein, one of the four components of the glycine cleavage system,is a tetrahydrofolate dependent aminomethyltransferase. It catalyzes the transfer of the methylene carbon unit to tetrahydrofolate from the methylamine group covalently attached to the lipoamide arm of H-protein. To gain insight into the T-protein function at the molecular level, we have determined the first crystal structure of T-protein from Thermotoga maritima by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction method of x-ray crystallography and refined four structures: the apoform; the tetrahydrofolate complex; the folinic acid complex; and the lipoic acid complex. The overall fold of T-protein is similar to that of the C-terminal tetrahydrofolate-binding region (residues 421-830) of Arthrobacter globiformis dimethylglycine oxidase. Tetrahydrofolate (or folinic acid) is bound near the center of the tripartite T-protein. Lipoic acid is bound adjacent to the tetrahydrofolate binding pocket, thus defining the interaction surface for H-protein binding. A homology model of the human T-protein provides the structural framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of nonketotic hyperglycinemia due to missense mutations of the human T-protein.},

abstract = {We describe a new method (T-Coffee) for multiple sequence alignment that provides a dramatic improvement in accuracy with a modest sacrifice in speed as compared to the most commonly used alternatives. The method is broadly based on the popular progressive approach to multiple alignment but avoids the most serious pitfalls caused by the greedy nature of this algorithm. With T-Coffee we pre-process a data set of all pair-wise alignments between the sequences. This provides us with a library of alignment information that can be used to guide the progressive alignment. Intermediate alignments are then based not only on the sequences to be aligned next but also on how all of the sequences align with each other. This alignment information can be derived from heterogeneous sources such as a mixture of alignment programs and/or structure superposition. Here, we illustrate the power of the approach by using a combination of local and global pair-wise alignments to generate the library. The resulting alignments are significantly more reliable, as determined by comparison with a set of 141 test cases, than any of the popular alternatives that we tried. The improvement, especially clear with the more difficult test cases, is always visible, regardless of the phylogenetic spread of the sequences in the tests.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sequence similarity searching is a very important bioinformatics task. While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications. RESULTS: We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site. CONCLUSION: The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences. We have also improved the user interface of the command-line applications.},

abstract = {T-protein is a component of the glycine cleavage system and catalyzes the tetrahydrofolate-dependent reaction. To determine the folate-binding site on the enzyme, 14C-labeled methylenetetrahydropteroyltetraglutamate (5,10-CH2-H4PteGlu4) was enzymatically synthesized from methylenetetrahydrofolate (5, 10-CH2-H4folate) and [U-14C]glutamic acid and subjected to cross-linking with the recombinant Escherichia coli T-protein using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, a zero-length cross-linker between amino and carboxyl groups. The cross-linked product was digested with lysylendopeptidase, and the resulting peptides were separated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Amino acid sequencing of the labeled peptides revealed that three lysine residues at positions 78, 81, and 352 were involved in the cross-linking with polyglutamate moiety of 5, 10-CH2-H4PteGlu4. The comparable experiment with 5,10-CH2-H4folate revealed that Lys-81 and Lys-352 were also involved in cross-linking with the monoglutamate form. Mutants with single or multiple replacement(s) of these lysine residues to glutamic acid were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and subjected to kinetic analysis. The single mutation of Lys-352 caused similar increase (2-fold) in Km values for both folate substrates, but that of Lys-81 affected greatly the Km value for 5,10-CH2-H4PteGlu4 rather than for 5,10-CH2-H4folate. It is postulated that Lys-352 may serve as the primary binding site to alpha-carboxyl group of the first glutamate residue nearest the p-aminobenzoic acid ring of 5,10-CH2-H4folate and 5,10-CH2-H4PteGlu4, whereas Lys-81 may play a key role to hold the second glutamate residue through binding to alpha-carboxyl group of the second glutamate residue.},

@article{Marchler-Bauer2011,
abstract = {NCBI's Conserved Domain Database (CDD) is a resource for the annotation of protein sequences with the location of conserved domain footprints, and functional sites inferred from these footprints. CDD includes manually curated domain models that make use of protein 3D structure to refine domain models and provide insights into sequence/structure/function relationships. Manually curated models are organized hierarchically if they describe domain families that are clearly related by common descent. As CDD also imports domain family models from a variety of external sources, it is a partially redundant collection. To simplify protein annotation, redundant models and models describing homologous families are clustered into superfamilies. By default, domain footprints are annotated with the corresponding superfamily designation, on top of which specific annotation may indicate high-confidence assignment of family membership. Pre-computed domain annotation is available for proteins in the Entrez/Protein dataset, and a novel interface, Batch CD-Search, allows the computation and download of annotation for large sets of protein queries. CDD can be accessed via http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml.},

abstract = {Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) accounts for most of the organic sulfur fluxes from primary to secondary producers in marine microbial food webs. Incubations of natural communities and axenic cultures with radio-labeled DMSP showed that dominant phytoplankton groups of the ocean, the unicellular cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus and diatoms, as well as heterotrophic bacteria take up and assimilate DMSP sulfur, thus diverting a proportion of plankton-produced organic sulfur from emission into the atmosphere.},
