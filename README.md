BCH3BMA-annotathon
==================

Project Makefiles and LaTeX/knitr documents for a university meta-genomics analysis assignment.

I am a stubborn budding biologist/bioinformatician and decided to make my life significantly harder by attempting to make my homework reproducible. Most analysis can be done entirely using the makefile commands.mk. Swissprot structural and functional analysis was done using EMBL and ExPASy webserver tools.
